# Road Speed Adjuster

**Road Speed Adjuster** is a powerful and intuitive tool that lets you take full control over speed limits across your entire city. Supporting **Roads, Train tracks, Tram tracks, and Subway rails**, this mod gives you fine-tuned control over how fast vehicles should travel on any network type (waterways coming soon).

## 🎛️ Key Features

*   **Adjust speeds on individual segments** with a simple click.
*   **Click-and-drag selection** to modify multiple segments at once.
*   Works seamlessly across:
*   🚗 **Roads**
*   🚊 **Tram tracks**
*   🚆 **Train tracks**
*   🚇 **Subway rails**

Note: Vehicles are still limited by their max speeds

## ⚠️ Important Warning

Removing this mod **does not reset** your customized speed limits. Any speeds you set will **remain applied to the network segments** even after the mod is removed.
